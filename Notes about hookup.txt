Temperature probe:
red: 5V (VIN pin on photon)
black: GND
white: D0 pin on photon


Door switch: (set pin to have pull_up resistor, and wire switch from D1 to GND)
switch open: door is not open (5V)
switch closed: door is 100% open (GND)


Door button: (set pin to have pull-up resistor. Wire NC1 (yellow) to D2 and C1 (black) to GND)
red = +12V (or +5 in debug mode)
green = GND
